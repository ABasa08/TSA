Feature 1: Advanced Crop Efficiency Planner
Description
Predicts the yield of a specified crop based on inputs like soil quality, farm size, fertilizer levels, and irrigation efficiency.

Usage

Select Feature 1 from the main menu.
Provide the following inputs when prompted:
Crop Type (e.g., wheat, corn, soy, rice)
Soil Quality (Integer between 1-100, higher is better)
Farm Size (in acres)
Additional Fertilizer Amount (kg/acre)
Irrigation Efficiency (Float between 0.5-1.0)
The application will display:
Optimized planting layout
Predicted yield with a 95% confidence interval
Recommendations for improving crop efficiency

Enter crop type (e.g., wheat, corn, soy, rice) [What crop are you planning?]: wheat
Enter soil quality (1-100) [Higher = better soil]: 75
Enter farm size (in acres) [Total area for the crop]: 50
Enter additional fertilizer amount (kg/acre) [Extra fertilizer to boost yield]: 10
Enter irrigation efficiency (0.5-1.0) [0.5 = low efficiency, 1.0 = high efficiency]: 0.85

Optimized Planting Layout: 50.00 acres of wheat
Predicted Yield: 312.50 units
95% Confidence Interval: (302.50, 322.50)
Recommendations:
- Adjust fertilizer input as per soil nutrient testing.
